Network Protocols 

Protocols are a set of rules and conventions that define how devices communicate over a network.

They ensure consistent and reliable communicateion between different systems, regardless of hardware or software differences.

Just as people speaking different languages need a translator, devices on a network use protocols to 'understand' each other.

Example of protocols 
TCP (transmission control protocol)
UDP( User Datagram protocol)
HTTP/S (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
FTP(File transfer protocol)

Network protocols are foundation of modern communication over internet. They ensure that data is transferred accurately, securely, and efficiently between devices, enabling seamless communication across the globe.
