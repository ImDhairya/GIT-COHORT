DNS :- 
DNS is a hierarchal and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network. It translates domain names easily memorized by humans into numerical IP addresses that computers use to identify and communicate with each other. 

How DNS resolves domain names to IP addresses

DNS resolution is the porcess of finding the IP address associated with a domain name. 

This involves querying a series of DNS servers, starting with the root servers, to find authoritative name for the domain. The authoritative name server contains the DNS records for the domain, including the IP address. Once the resolver has the IP address, it returns it to the browser, which can then connect to the web server hosting the website.

*A record: An A record maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.   
*AAAA record: An AAAA record maps a domain name to an IPv6 address.   
*CNAME record: A CNAME record creates an alias for a domain name.   
*MX record: An MX record specifies the mail servers responsible for accepting email messages on behalf of a domain.

DNS Hierarchy: It is a tree like structure that consists of:

  1) Root DNS servers: This is the top servers are the top of the DNS hierarchy. They are responsible for directing queries to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) servers.

  2) Top-level domain (TLDs): TLDs are the last part of a domain name, such as .com, .org, or .net. Each TLD is managed by a different organization.

  3) Authoritative DNS servers: Authoritative DNS servers hold the DNS records for specific domains. They are responsible for providing the correct IP addresses for those domains.

  Browsers query DNS servers to load websites

  When a user types a domain name into their web browser, the browser performs the below functions

  1) Browser checks their own cache for their ip addresses.

  2) If the ip address is not in the operating system's cache, the browser sends a DNS query to a recursive DNS resolver.

  3) If the IP address is not in the operating system's cache, the browser sends a DNS query to recursive DNS resolver.

  4) The resolver queries the root servers, TLD servers, and the authorative name servers to find the IP address.

  5) The resolver return the IP address to the browser.

  6) The browser connects to the web server using the IP address.

  7) The web server sends the website data to the browser.

  8) The browser renders the website.


  Recursive queries: A recursive query is a DNS query in which the DNS server is required to return a complete answer or an error message. 

  Caching: DNS servers cache DNS records to imporove performance. When a DNS server receives a query for a domain name that it has already resolved, it can return the answer from its cache without having to query other DNS servers.

  TTL: The TTL is a value that specifies how long a DNS record can be cached. After the TTL expires, the DNS record is removed from the cache.

  DNS is a critical component of the Internet that translates domain name into IP addresses. This process involves querying various DNS servers in a specific order.
