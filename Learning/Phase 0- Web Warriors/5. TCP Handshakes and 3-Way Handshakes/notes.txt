TCP  is a communication protocol used to communicate between 2 devices over a network  between client and server

TCP handshake setu up the communication parameters between the client and teh server. 

It ensures that:
1) Both devices are ready to communicate
2) Data transferred will be reliable and ordered  // commonly refered to as 3 way handshake

Steps in 3-Way handshake

1) SYN (Synchronize) 
  * The client sends SYN packet to the server to initiate the connection.
  * This packet includes an initial sequence number(ISN) chosen by the client.

  Purpose: "I want to start communication and here’s my sequence number."

  * Example client -> Server: SYN(Seq = X)

2) SYN-ACK (Synchronize + Acknowledge): 

  * The server acknowledges the client's SYN by sending a SYN-ACK packet.
  * The SYN-ACK packet includes:
  1) The servers own sequence number.
  2) An acknowledgement of the client's sequence number(client ISN + 1)

  Purpose: 'I acknowledge your request, and here's my sequence number.'

  * Example: Server → Client: SYN-ACK (Seq = Y, Ack = X + 1)

  3) ACK (Acknowledge): 
  * The client acknowledges the server's SYN-ACK packet by sending an ACK packet.

  Purpose: "I acknowledge your response. Connection established."

  * Example: Client → Server: ACK (Seq = X + 1, Ack = Y + 1)
