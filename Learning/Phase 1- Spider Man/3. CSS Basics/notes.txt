CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It allows you to style web pages, enhancing their appearance and user experience.

Purpose of CSS:
Separation of Content and Design: Keeps HTML focused on structure and CSS on styling.
Styling Flexibility: Offers tools to style elements with colors, fonts, layouts, and animations.
Reusability: Enables consistent styles across multiple pages with external stylesheets.
Responsiveness: Adapts designs for different screen sizes and devices.
