text align means that not the aligning of the center of the screen

but also means that it will be align center to the div that it is contained in


inline = Takes only the space required by the element.(no margin/ padding)

block = Takes full space available in width.

inline-block = Similar to inline but we can set margin & padding.

none= to remove element from document flow.



/* display inline won't let us set margines in the top and bottom rather it will only let us set the margines in right and left so we rather choose inlin-block property for the use of setting the display */
